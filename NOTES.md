- search being a bit weird, but works
- Also why did recent-render change?
- add local render filter, just on keydown or something? OR JUST TYPE ANYWHERE INTO THE SEARCHBOX???
- Use half res videos for main page, with "click for full res". Maybe only use VP9? Support?
  - videos don't work on xbox
- xbox/landscape styling is bad
  - also make carousel buttons bigger on mobile
