- Latest render looks at lastWriteTime, needs to read the index.md :(
- add local render filter, just on keydown or something? OR JUST TYPE ANYWHERE INTO THE SEARCHBOX???
- Use half res videos for main page, with "click for full res", just two links (VP9, mp4?). VP9 not supported on safari
  - videos don't work on xbox
- xbox/landscape styling is bad
