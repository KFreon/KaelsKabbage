## Furies of Calderon
Series (complete)
Good
When they come of age, they bond with an elemental fury, however one boy still doesn't have one.

The majority of the story is pretty good, but once finished, it's got some pacing issues.  
It feels like some parts did't get fleshed out enough or got rushed.  
Still, an enjoyable read.  


## Elantris
Stand alone
Good
The city of light once stood proud, but one day the ancient magic vanished, leaving panic and mystery.
A mysterious illness can strike anyone anytime, condeming them to death in the city of Elantris.
Will the prince escape?

Well written as with most sanderson books.  
Good story as well, which is always great.  


## Way of kings
Series (incomplete)
Good- Whole stormlight series
Roshar is a rough place, Highstorms ravige the land, wars, but on the shattered plains wealth and riches can be fond.  
But Kaladin, a deserter, may find other things. 

The biggest long running sanderson story, well written, interesting.  
The only two downsides are that it's ongoing and there's the usual Sanderson Event where something happens that I don't like 
SPOILERS
Dalinar just taking hold of the Stormfather, was not pleased at all.  
The focus on Navani and fabrials later on, bit boring.


## The Linesman
Series (complete)
Good
Ship FTL drives use the 5 lines and onoly limesmen can maintain them.  
One such linesmen has a strange way of working with the lines, and it comes in handy when a mysterious rich lady contracts his services.

It's a bit of a strange book, but well written with interesting if unusual characters.  
I really liked it.
The ending is so wide open it feels a bit unfinished though.  


## Dungeon crawler carl
Series (not sure, not finished)
Good
The world once had height, but it no longer does, and Carl and Princess Donut plan to fight their way through the new dungeon beneath the Earth before it collapses.  
Can they win control back or will the powers arrayed against them win out?

Pretty good so far, well written and good characters.  
Hard to know how things are going to work out.  


## Dragons blood
Series (completed)
Good
The mages used to be a power on the continent but when the armies destroyed them, only one made it to the stasis chambers.  
Her sword missing, lost centuries later, she's got to keep her wits about herself, but of course there's a hunky boi she has to lie to to get away with it? Can she? Of course not.  

It's good, and on one hand it's a little slice of the world, which is kinda nice to see.  That is, it doesn't bother to explain a lot of things, which is kinda nice.  
But there wasn't a strong thread through it all.  
No strong conclusion or arc.  
Still a good read though.  


## Children of time
Series (didnt finish it)
Not bad
Humanity has exhausted the resources on Earth, triggering a resource war.  
In an effort to save the species, a genetic uplift begins on another planet, but goes wrong of course.  

You sure end up seeing spiders and ants in a new light.  
It's...well written and a decent story, but it's very long winded.  
It also kinda lacks a throughline at this point (partway through the second book, might finish it eventually)


## The expanse
Series (complete)
Good
A potential near future earth is in tensions with the belt and Mars over resources and ownership.  
A simple ice freighter making a trip out to the ice and back is going smoothly until they get a distress signal...

This is such a good series.  
Through lines, great characters and lots of them, cool scifi.  
It's a great read.  


## Terms of enlistment
Series (complete)
Not bad
The lankies attacked for unknown reasons triggering a resource and military crisis around the human colonies.  
Grayson has to sort it all out.  

It's an ok read, but I was really hoping for more info/story on the Lankies.  
They're not in most of it, just a bit of a boogieman.  
Still, some decent characters and scifi concepts and such.  


## Dandelion
Series (ongoing)  
Good  
A generation ship, escaping a warring earth, is almost hit by an unknown object on approach to it's destination.  
The young people training for their new life surviving on the plant manage to escape the attack, but what awaits them on the surface?

The writing lets this one down a fair bit. I don't know exactly what it is.  
Maybe it's a pacing thing, maybe it's a natural reactions thing (e.g. people just not reacting right) 
Once again it's hard to know how it'll end up, but it's a decent read.
