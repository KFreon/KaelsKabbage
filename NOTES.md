- Investigate Netlify large media and Git LFS so we can just save the full image in repo and dynamically serve it
- Make postcards for actual posts
  - put postcard as top background on posts?
- Somehow auto generate the slug, postcard text, title (auto remove date)


  What I use:
  - onenote/obsidian
  - azure data studio
  - gitkraken
  - slack/teams
  - edge
  - hugo/netlify
  - VS/VSCode
  - PC specs?
