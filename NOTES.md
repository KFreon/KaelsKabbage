## Furies of Calderon
Series (complete)
Good
When they come of age, they bond with an elemental fury, however one boy still doesn't have one.

The majority of the story is pretty good, but once finished, it's got some pacing issues.  
It feels like some parts did't get fleshed out enough or got rushed.  
Still, an enjoyable read.  


## Elantris
Stand alone
Good
The city of light once stood proud, but one day the ancient magic vanished, leaving panic and mystery.
A mysterious illness can strike anyone anytime, condeming them to death in the city of Elantris.
Will the prince escape?

Well written as with most sanderson books.  
Good story as well, which is always great.  


## Way of kings
Series (incomplete)
Good- Whole stormlight series
Roshar is a rough place, Highstorms ravige the land, wars, but on the shattered plains wealth and riches can be fond.  
But Kaladin, a deserter, may find other things. 

The biggest long running sanderson story, well written, interesting.  
The only two downsides are that it's ongoing and there's the usual Sanderson Event where something happens that I don't like 
SPOILERS
Dalinar just taking hold of the Stormfather, was not pleased at all.  
The focus on Navani and fabrials later on, bit boring.


## The Linesman
Series (complete)
Good
Ship FTL drives use the 5 lines and onoly limesmen can maintain them.  
One such linesmen has a strange way of working with the lines, and it comes in handy when a mysterious rich lady contracts his services.

It's a bit of a strange book, but well written with interesting if unusual characters.  
I really liked it.
The ending is so wide open it feels a bit unfinished though.  


## Dungeon crawler carl
Series (not sure, not finished)
Good
The world once had height, but it no longer does, and Carl and Princess Donut plan to fight their way through the new dungeon beneath the Earth before it collapses.  
Can they win control back or will the powers arrayed against them win out?

Pretty good so far, well written and good characters.  
Hard to know how things are going to work out.  


## Dragons blood
Series (completed)
Good
The mages used to be a power on the continent but when the armies destroyed them, only one made it to the stasis chambers.  
Her sword missing, lost centuries later, she's got to keep her wits about herself, but of course there's a hunky boi she has to lie to to get away with it? Can she? Of course not.  

It's good, and on one hand it's a little slice of the world, which is kinda nice to see.  That is, it doesn't bother to explain a lot of things, which is kinda nice.  
But there wasn't a strong thread through it all.  
No strong conclusion or arc.  
Still a good read though.  


## Children of time
Series (didnt finish it)
Not bad
Humanity has exhausted the resources on Earth, triggering a resource war.  
In an effort to save the species, a genetic uplift begins on another planet, but goes wrong of course.  

You sure end up seeing spiders and ants in a new light.  
It's...well written and a decent story, but it's very long winded.  
It also kinda lacks a throughline at this point (partway through the second book, might finish it eventually)


## The expanse
Series (complete)
Good
A potential near future earth is in tensions with the belt and Mars over resources and ownership.  
A simple ice freighter making a trip out to the ice and back is going smoothly until they get a distress signal...

This is such a good series.  
Through lines, great characters and lots of them, cool scifi.  
It's a great read.  


## Terms of enlistment
Series (complete)
Not bad
The lankies attacked for unknown reasons triggering a resource and military crisis around the human colonies.  
Grayson has to sort it all out.  

It's an ok read, but I was really hoping for more info/story on the Lankies.  
They're not in most of it, just a bit of a boogieman.  
Still, some decent characters and scifi concepts and such.  


## Dandelion
Series (ongoing)  
Good  
A generation ship, escaping a warring earth, is almost hit by an unknown object on approach to it's destination.  
The young people training for their new life surviving on the plant manage to escape the attack, but what awaits them on the surface?

The writing lets this one down a fair bit. I don't know exactly what it is.  
Maybe it's a pacing thing, maybe it's a natural reactions thing (e.g. people just not reacting right) 
Once again it's hard to know how it'll end up, but it's a decent read.


## Contest
Standalone
Good
A normal man is suddenly a part of a huge contest for the fate of the Earth.  
It's such a contest that some may go to any lengths to win.  

Short and sweet, well put together.  
Has a nice vibe of mystery but gets nicely wrapped up in the end.  


## Temple
Standalone
Good
I DON"T REMEMBER


## Ice station
Standalone, but ties into future books
Good
The American relief force rushes to their Antarctic station after a classified message, but are they the first to arrive? 
Can they trust anyone they meet once there?  

Great book. Typical of Matthew Reilly, lots of action and twists.  
Good characters, good world building, etc  
It's all a bit simplistic, but it's like Maccas. Simple but delicious.    


## Area 7
Standalone, but ties into past and future books
Good
The president and his escort are on the way to a secret military base, but when he arrives, something is off with the soldiers.  
Scarecrow's forces must keep the president out of trouble at all costs.

Another good one in the military vein.  
It's good and has all the usual characters and intrigue.
Short and sweet.  


## Scarecrow
Technically standalone I guess, but does make more sense after the other two.
Good
Scarecrow has a bounty placed on his head, but why and by whom?  
What will he have to do to survive the greatest bounty hunters in the world?  

This is another great book, but I will say this is where it starts to get a bit excessive.  
I still definitely enjoyed it though.  


## Seven ancient wonders
Series (who knows if it's finished)
Good
A treasure hunter searches for the mysterious seventh ancient wonder, but other parties are in too, and a race for the fate of the world is on!

Excessive is good here though :D
Ancient mythic history is always cool, and it feels pretty cool here too.  
It's all highly improbable and I don't care.  
But...foreshadowing, this is pretty much the only one in the series I like without qualification.  


## The chess one
Standalone
Not bad
CANT REMEMBER


## Murderbot
Series (ongoing?)
Good
A cyborg security bot assigned to a research team, which is fine with him. Easy job, lots of time his shows.  
But when an alien artifact brings unwanted attention, he'll have to take extreme actions to protect his charges. 

That synopsis is a weak description of these books, they're great and interesting and has some great worldbuilding.  
It's that slice of life world building where it slowly fills things in but doesn't just exposit everything.  
They're out of order though, like the 4th book or something as released first but actually comes after the 5th book in the story.
Something like that. 


## Sphere
Standalone
Good
The submarine research team finds a wreacked...thing at the bottom of the ocean.  
The team finds something inside, which finds something inside each of them.  
Even if they make it to the surface, will they be the same?  

An older scifi book but it checks out.  
The storytelling isn't quite my bag, but it kept me reading and wondering.  
The ending is an old school brutal ending too.  


## Prey
Standalone
Good
A mans wife invites him to her secret research base for a demonstration, but...something isn't right.  
His life is in danger from his own wife...or is it?  




## Jurassic Park


## Magicians apprentice
Series (didn't finish it)
Not bad
A boy who learns magic faces off against a mysterious enemy.

I don't remember much about this one. 
The writing style didn't click with me, the story wasn't up my alley somehow either, despite me thinking it would be.


## The fold
Standalone (I think?)
Good
Mike works a nice quiet job teaching, until a friend from his past at DARPA has a mystery he can't refuse.  
When time and space start misbehaving, Mike is the only one who can set it straight.  

It has some nice characters and storytelling.  
Sometimes it gets a bit lost in the weeds though.  
And the ending left a bit to be desired.  


## Dead silence
Standalone
Good
Her job almost complete, a distress signal catches her attention.  
An abandoned ship that looks too good to be true, but when little details start to get weird, the crew wonders whether it's worth it...

I liked this one, the reviews called it "Titanic cross Event Horizon" which sounds about right.  
The writing and storytelling were a bit simple, but it got the point across.  


## Dead witch walking
Series (completed)
Good
Magic coexists with the rest of the world, brought to the fore by accident.  
Rachel Morgan is a witch who wants to leave her job, only when she does, she's marked for death...

Oh boy, ok this is a weird one.  
**Technically**, this is basically a romance series, which is why it's so frustrating that the story is pretty well written and has some interesting characters...which are all butchered for sexiness later on, but anyway. 
The world is interesting and kinda well built.  
I'm a little annoyed I got sucked into it, but I did cos it's kinda good.  


## Deltora quest



## Hyperion
Series (completed, I believe?)
Good, mostly
As the pilgrims head to the time tombs, they each tell their story.  
Why does it seem like they all might...tie together?  

The first book is 100% pure scifi cocaine. 
It's so good.  
The quality does decrease, but only because it felt more and more tropey and leant more on stranger things.  
Even so, the last book is still fantastic.  


## That one about the guy who imitates a prince and becomes him in the end
Series (kinda maybe?)
Good
A travelling entertainer gets roped into being a body double for the prince.  
He's good at it too...too good?  

I really liked how much it got done in such a short story.  
Good characters, good world building, good storytelling, etc
