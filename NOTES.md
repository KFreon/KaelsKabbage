- Investigate Netlify large media and Git LFS so we can just save the full image in repo and dynamically serve it

  AV1?
  https://www.meziantou.net/using-av1-video-codec-to-reduce-web-page-size.htm
  IT WAORSK!!!! 
  Needs `choco install ffmpeg-full` to get the svtav1
  something like `ffmpeg -i .\input.mp4 -qp 30 -c:v libsvtav1 -preset 3 output.mp4`
  Note that current fmfpeg builds 5.0.x don't support CRF or newer `-svtav1-params` functions so need `qp` to standin for CRF.
  Preset controls the rest of it


Default video size should be HALFSIZE.
Bigger link goes to fullsizes
QUartersize shows on small screens and tile view



  MOBILE site?
  themes don't work, or is it just my phone?
  works fine on the emulator - Caching maybe?
