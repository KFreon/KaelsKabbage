- Investigate Netlify large media and Git LFS so we can just save the full image in repo and dynamically serve it
- Make postcards for actual posts
  - put postcard as top background on posts?
- Somehow auto generate the slug, postcard text, title (auto remove date)
- Clean up c# projects and stylesheets and shortcodes
- check header sizes and readability on mobile
- better tags view and navigation from click
- LOSE GA for netlify analytics?
- RSS?

  What I use:
