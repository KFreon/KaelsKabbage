I remember seeing the [original video](https://youtu.be/It9DOTaFA7Q) a while ago, and then he released a tutorial!  
So I wanted to try it out.  
Only...it didn't quite do what I wanted, so I had to tweak and tweak and tweak until I'd rebuilt the whole bounce curve addon as a [node group](./Bounce%20Curve%20Nodegroup.7z).
