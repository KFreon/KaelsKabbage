<!--more-->  

.net --> dotnetcore post
DOTNETCORE upgrade
- Also did autofac and Nancy
- ApiController --> ControllerBase
- Auth differences (policy vs custom attributes)
- Autofac differences, need custom method to register generics
---- Also very simplified
- THAT DATABSE thing where stamping weas done with http current thread or something
- Such test differences due to needing custom web factory based on in-memory hosting
-- Autofac as well
