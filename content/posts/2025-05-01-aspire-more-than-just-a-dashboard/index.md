I was halfway through writing this when some guy called David Fowler [beat me to the punch](https://medium.com/@davidfowl/model-run-ship-the-new-way-to-build-distributed-apps-48d67286a665)

Well it does more than that, and it's pretty cool and easy!





That's all nice locally, but how does it deploy? How can I actually use it in the real world?
